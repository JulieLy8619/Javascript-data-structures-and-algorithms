# For our Prework Code Challenge, we were tasked with 4 problems

## Problem 1: Array Max Result
#### Task: Request 5 numbers (between 1-10) from the user and ask the user to select a number. Then provide a score based on the user's selected number and the frequency of that number in the array.'

## Problem 2: Leap Year Calculator
#### Task: Take in a year and determine if it is a leap year or not.

## Problem 3: Perfect Sequence
#### Task: Take in an array and determine if it is a perfect sequence or not.

## Problem 4 Sum of Rows
#### Task: Take in a matrix from the user and return a single dimension array of the sum of the rows of the matrix

## Images showing successful output
#### Shows all outputs as expected (like it was a leap year and it was a perfect sequence)

#### Still shows correct output for bad data (like it was not a leap year and it was not a perfect sequence )

#### To show the corrected output (a 1 dimension array) for problem 4 because I had it as the last column in the matrix in the other images
